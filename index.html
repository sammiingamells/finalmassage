        <h1>LGBT Massage By Flo</h1>
        <section class="one-half">
            <p>My aim is to provide truly holistic massage to LGBT people. I not only acknowledge the roles that mind, body and spirit play in our health but also wider societal power structures. I seek to ease some of the physical symptoms of depression, anxiety and the stresses of surviving late capitalism.
                            My services are
                            • Body positive
                            • Blame and shame free
                            • Consent lead
                            • Gender neutral
                            • Priced by a sliding scale of affordability

        <h1>What To Expect</h1>
    <section class="one-half">
        <p>Many people I treat have never had a massage before or are nervous and don't know what to expect. That's fine! Here is basic run down of what to expect in and average appointment with me.

            It's a good idea to arrive at Open Barber's a couple of minutes early to your appointment. There are Sofas you can wait on and you are welcome to help yourself to a hot drink.
            When I am ready to see you I will come and collect you from the sofas. We will have a short consultation where I will ask you some of the following questions:
        </p>
        <p>
    <ul id="massagebyflobullet1">
        <li>How are you feeling?</li>
        <li>Have you had a massage before?</li>
        <li>What are the main aims of today's treatment?</li>
        <li>What area's of your body would you like to work on?</li>
        <li>Do you have any injury's, Illness's, allergies or medical issues that you would like to disclose?</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>I will then let you know that:
    <ul id="massagebyflobullet1">
        <li> We can stop at any time – no questions asked </li>
        <li> I will always let you know where on your body I am about to start working </li>
        <li> You are welcome to keep any items of clothing on </li>
        <li> You will be covered by a sheet the whole time and I will only expose the body part I am currently working on </li>
        <li> I will check in with you about pressure </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I will leave the room to let you get changed, onto the couch and under the sheet. I will knock on the door in a couple of minutes and check you are ready. I will turn on some relaxing massage music and commence with the agreed upon treatment.
I will stop 5mins before the hour is up and leave the room to allow you to get dressed. Once you are dressed I will come back in for a brief chat to see how you are feeling and to give you aftercare advice. Then you pay me directly (rather than the main till) and the appointment is over!
